Just because I'm too lazy sometimes to think about things, just decided to put a script apart specifically to specificy a list to add a word from.
Only in the future I'll just add a sysargv to put the damn specific url or website I want to test. Not now. I'm tired.

Now I'm happy, cuz I already have a scanner up and running.
